Bro I’m gonna be straight with you — **there is NO 100% free cloud that will run Ollama + FastAPI + React together**, because:

### ❌ Ollama requires:

* A full Linux VM
* At least **8GB RAM**
* Background process
* Full CPU access
* A real server (not serverless)

And ALL clouds charge money for a VM with those specs.

BUT…

👇👇👇

# 🟢 **THE ONLY REAL “FREE” WAY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS**

## ⭐ **Deploy everything on your friend’s laptop or your own PC as the “LLM server”**

And then deploy:

* **Frontend** → free host
* **Backend (FastAPI)** → free host
* **Ollama** → runs on laptop/PC 24/7 (local server)

This is the ONLY setup that is fully free and DOES work.

---

# 💥 **THE FREE DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE**

```
React (on Netlify/Vercel) ➜ FastAPI backend (on Render free tier) ➜ Ollama (running on your friend's laptop)
```

Let’s break it down:

---

# 🟢 **1. FRONTEND — FREE DEPLOYMENT**

You can deploy React **100% free** on:

* Vercel
* Netlify
* GitHub Pages

These serve static files → perfect for React.

---

# 🔵 **2. BACKEND (FastAPI) — FREE DEPLOYMENT**

Use:

### ⭐ Render.com — FREE tier supports FastAPI

* Zero cost
* Free web server
* Sleep after inactivity (fine for dev)

FastAPI runs on Render free tier using:

```
gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app.main:app
```

---

# 🟣 **3. OLLAMA — MUST RUN ON A MACHINE YOU CONTROL**

Clouds **do NOT** allow:

* background daemons
* GPU access
* models > 2GB
* persistent services
* ports like 11434
* custom system services

So ONLY computation home is:

### ✔ Your laptop

### ✔ Your friend’s laptop

### ✔ A PC at home

### ✔ A Raspberry Pi (if small model)

This acts like your **private inference server**.

---

# 🧠 **HOW THE FREE SYSTEM WORKS TOGETHER**

### Your React frontend sends API calls to Render FastAPI:

```
https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/ask
```

FastAPI receives the request and calls:

```
http://YOUR_FRIENDS_IP:11434/api/generate
```

That IP could be:

* Your friend’s home internet IP
* Or Radmin VPN
* Or Tailscale
* Or Ngrok tunnel
* Or Localtonet

Ollama responds with the answer → FastAPI → React UI.

---

# 🧩 **You need only 1 thing for this to work:**

## Your friend’s laptop must expose this port:

```
11434 (Ollama)
```

so Render FastAPI can reach it.

---

# 🟢 FREE TOOLS TO EXPOSE YOUR FRIEND’S LAPTOP

### ⭐ 1. Ngrok (FREE)

Expose Ollama:

```bash
ngrok http 11434
```

You get:

```
https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app
```

Set OLLAMA_URL in summarizer.py:

```python
OLLAMA_URL = "https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app/api/generate"
```

---

### ⭐ 2. Localtonet (FREE)

Similar to ngrok, but better speed.

---

### ⭐ 3. Tailscale (FREE for 3 devices)

Zero-config private VPN.

Your FastAPI server can call your friend’s machine **as if on same network**.

---

# 🟢 FINAL FREE DEPLOYMENT STACK

```
========  FREE  ========
React frontend → Vercel
FastAPI backend → Render free tier
======== NOT FREE ========
Ollama → runs on your/laptop PC (but FREE hardware)
```

TOTAL COST = **₹0**
(since Ollama uses your laptop as free GPU/CPU)

---

# 🎯 TL;DR (Gen-Z Explanation)

Clouds won’t host Ollama for free
but your **friend’s laptop can be your free AI server**.

Frontend + backend = free
LLM runs locally → free
Everyone wins.

---

# 🔥 If you want, I can help you set up:

### ✔ Render deployment

### ✔ Ngrok setup for Ollama

### ✔ Environment variables

### ✔ Updated OLLAMA_URL

### ✔ Production-ready main.py

### ✔ React build & deployment

Just say:

👉 **“Setup free deployment for me”**
